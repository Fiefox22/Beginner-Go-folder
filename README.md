# Beginner Coding Practice

## Description
This is a beginner project where I am learning the programming languages **Go** and **C**.  
The goal of this project is to practice basic programming concepts such as:

- Printing messages to the console
- Using variables
- Working with arrays and slices
- Writing simple loops and functions

This project is meant to help me build a strong foundation in coding while exploring two different languages and their syntax.
